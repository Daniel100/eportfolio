										<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>

										<h3>Summary:</h3> <p />
										In the ever-expanding field of Data Science, there are many exciting new developments as well as challenges faced by the next generation of professionals. <p />
										Yildirim (2020) wrote about the 'dark side' of Data Science; it poses some difficult questions highlighting the possibility that small to mid-sized companies often employ too few Data Scientists, which forces them to cover a wider range of related techniques, resulting in an overwhelming workload. I agree with Yildirim (2020) and with In Wong (2022) that it can appear overwhelming. Despite the overwhelming workload, this can be achieved in the long run by continuously developing the requisite skills, also supported by Anders et al. (2007: 2): '... the evidence showed that experts are always made, not born.' <p />
										
										Data Science can be applied in almost every professional field, from big Pharma to research, business and many more (Dhar, 2013). For this reason, I do not agree with Saxena (2021) that there will be a loss of jobs in this sector due to automated Data Science workflows. <br />  
										
										This might result in reduced operative work, but it won't reduce the other aspects, such as the communication needed to show the findings (with management etc.). <br />  
										This is also supported by Geiger (2020, as cited in Goyal et al., 2020), that wrong questions are often asked in this field and highlights again the communications aspect of a Data Scientist. Furthermore, Sieminski (2022, as cited in Larson, 2022) supports this by highlighting that Data Scientists are imperative to the decision-making process. He also pointed out the necessity that Data Scientists need to adapt to changes. <br />
										In addition, The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022) estimates a growth of 22% in this job market between 2020 and 2030 for computer and information research scientists, which includes Data Scientists as well. I agree with Ghuloom (2022), that the examination of how this field evolves could help to be more accurate. <p />
										
										Data Science products need to be maintained on a regular basis, this also contributed to the points mentioned above and binds Data Science resources (Saxena, 2021). <br /> 
										But there needs to be further consideration: the Data Management Life Cycle defines the steps; collect, process, use, share and communicate, archive, and destroy (Texas A&M, 2020) and it must fit into the Data Governance framework, that all legal and organisational requirements, such as GDPR, can be met (QuestionPro, n.d.). <br /> 
										Furthermore, Data Master Management plays an important role in improving the data quality, which is again imperative to a Data Scientist's work (Profisse, 2018). <p />

											<h3>Summary:</h3> <p />

											Data irrefutably plays a more and more significant role in our society and economy. With this development comes challenges and risks such as stolen identity, leaks of sensitive data, and many more (European Commission, 2019:1). <p />

											These risks highlight the importance of data protection rules, defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (European Commission, 2019: 5). <p />

											IT Code of Conduct supports the GDPR and helps organizations to guard their values. This text provides a summary of my previous review of the British Computer Society's “IT Code of Conduct” (The Charter Institute for IT, 2021). <p />

											The Charter Institute for IT (2021) consists of “Public Interests”, “Professional Competence and Integrity”, “Duty to Relevant Authority”, and “Duty to the Profession”. Overall, this Code of Conduct is written very precisely; however, some of the professional standards outlined could be difficult to follow in practice.  
											“Public Interests” is especially relevant for personal data. Applying standards such as ISO 27000 to achieve high information security standards is good practice (Miller, 2019). <p />

											Furthermore, it is crucial to manage GDPR-relevant data properly; Master Data Management can help fulfil GDPR regulations (Profisee, N.D.). Khalid (2022, as cited in Cushman, 2018) states that Master Data Management can be seen as the foundation for GDPR. <p />

											If standards are not met regarding data security and GDPR, the probability that incidents occur increases. As Geiger (2022, as cited in National Cyber Security Centre, 2018) mentioned, GDPR is about privacy and security is only mentioned in that it must be processed securely'. I agree, but it also links IT and GDPR together. <p />

											An example is used in this post, which was recently all over the media in Austria, the cyber-attack on the federal state of Carinthia. A hacker group encrypted the hard drives of the federal government and made sensitive data available on the dark net (Dax, 2022). <p />

											I agree with Geiger (2022) that data breaches can always occur and GDPR can help reduce the impact. Sieminski (2022) commented on how criminals choose their victims by pinpointing the easiest targets with the highest benefits; they balance effort with benefits. I agree that making it more difficult for criminals to gather data is crucial for organizations.  <p />
